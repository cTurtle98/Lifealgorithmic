Course Description
------------------

Introduces skills required to administer UNIX/Linux systems. Skills include installing and configuring a popular distribution, such as RedHat Linux, maintaining file and file system structures, distributing and monitoring processes, starting and stopping the system for routine maintenance and troubleshooting, rebuilding and upgrading the kernel, configuring peripheral devices such as printers and modems, backing up and restoring files, and disaster recovery. Develops skills through using both graphical and command line user interfaces, and will be demonstrated by building a custom version of Linux. Prepares students for several industry standard Linux certifications.
