Course Description
------------------

Introduces skills required to administer UNIX/Linux systems. Skills include installing and configuring a popular distribution, such as RedHat Linux, maintaining file and file system structures, distributing and monitoring processes, starting and stopping the system for routine maintenance and troubleshooting, rebuilding and upgrading the kernel, configuring peripheral devices such as printers and modems, backing up and restoring files, and disaster recovery. Develops skills through using both graphical and command line user interfaces, and will be demonstrated by building a custom version of Linux. Prepares students for several industry standard Linux certifications.

Student Learner Outcomes
------------------------

* Manage filesystems
* Manage and customize user and group accounts
* Implement system performance optimization
  
Objectives
----------

* Describe the structural components of Unix/Linux systems and outline the similarities and differences among various distributions.
* Contrast command line and graphical user interfaces and evaluate the tradeoffs between the two.
* Install a UNIX/Linux System as a workstation or server to meet the needs of a small to medium company.
* Demonstrate a knowledge of boot loaders by configuring two operating systems to dual boot, and by recovering a system that won't boot.
* Define and customize the run levels into which a server will boot.
* Bring a system down and back up again after reorganizing or expanding storage space.
* Transfer files from one system to another using network protocols or removable storage devices.
* Configure a graphical desktop environment by editing the configuration files for the X Windows server, a window manager, and appropriate graphical clients.
* Use online manual pages and Internet web sites to discover proper command usage or how to use a new utility.
* Create, modify and delete user accounts and groups, and customize user profiles to meet specified security and productivity needs.
* Add, update and remove software packages using an appropriate package installation tool.
* Configure and manage terminals, modems, and printers.
* Configure system logging to collect information needed for troubleshooting and correcting system problems.
* Maintain optimal system performance by monitoring disk usage, scheduling processes, and removing resource bottlenecks.
* Perform a complete system backup and restore the system with that backup.
* Recover lost files and forgotten passwords.
* Restore an unstable system by identifying and removing one or more errant processes.
* Maintain operating system currency by upgrading to a new kernel and applying supplemental patches.
* Configure system and kernel resources by recompiling the kernel.
* Transform a single user workstation into a multiuser server.
* Explain the use of various commands used by a system administrator.
