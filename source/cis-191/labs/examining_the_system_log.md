## Introduction

For this project you will examine the system logs of a real machine and answer questions about the machine.

## Lab Procedure

Download the [TAR file](http://ea994bd4-a-9f1c7e1e-s-sites.googlegroups.com/a/lifealgorithmic.com/cabrillo-home/home/cis-191/lab-7-examining-the-system-log/cis191_lab7_logs.tar?attachauth=ANoY7coJ8PiH86Ka60YrtDr_M_yGEKzuZUPITnJ4sviqstgeghjoFp6cbasXtZ1sTd6YB4Y_hLWZyd3HEWi_MXBm8wBhBszntF92SiiC5hFE_ecmRL8uSZ2roymIMd9XwMJ2gNFmMdGV_gnMO8_EG5Vc6EwYjD_52JiswgR4a1GpxJlUuW3agBxLoT_QoZQHYgPdqUaniZTthFm3h2_mtHJtDQ_9bgidORwk_XquqjmslqXQX2jEY5nc2W6Pq_o9_ly__vif3CmDXDKKkgceLsZQ5RuGBcHOPY1yO7vMRfD9rBQXrHmGDy8%3D&attredirects=0&d=1) attached to this lab. The file contains several log files. Examine the log files and answer the following questions:
  - What dates do the log files cover?
  - How many times did the computer reboot during those dates?
  - How many Ethernet devices does the computer have and what is the manufacturer and model of each?
  - What IP address or addresses does the computer have?
  - What printers are configured on the computer?

## Extra Credit

The computer in question had a serious problem during the time covered by the logs. Using only the logs I was able to determine what the issue was. For extra credit you must examine the logs and determine what is causing the computer to crash and reboot.

## Turn In

Answers to the above questions on Canvas.
