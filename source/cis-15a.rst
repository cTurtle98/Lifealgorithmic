Course Description
------------------

Teaches the fundamental concepts and models of application development including the basic concepts of program design, data structures, programming, problem solving, programming logic, and fundamental design techniques for event-driven programs. Provides hands-on experience with a modern application programming language and development platform. May be offered in Distance-learning Format.

Student Learner Outcomes
------------------------

* Develop small programs that implement basic algorithmic designs.
* Organize and document program code following the principles of software engineering.
  
Objectives
----------

* Use primitive data types and data structures offered by the development environment.
* Choose an appropriate data structure for modeling a simple problem.
* Identify basic programming concepts.
* Write simple applications that relate to a specific domain.
* Design, implement, test, and debug a program that uses each of the following fundamental programming constructs: basic computation, simple I/O, standard conditional and iterative structures, and the definition of functions.
* Test applications with sample data.
* Apply core program control structures.

Grading Policy
--------------
