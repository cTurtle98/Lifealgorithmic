	 <p>Technology inspires me and I'm grateful to be able to share my love of tech with students. I've been an instructor at <a href="http://www.cabrillo.edu" target="_blank">Cabrillo College</a> since 2013. In that time I've taught many CIS and CS classes.</p>
	 <h4>Teaching</h4>
	 <p><b>Programming</b> is my passion and I've taught classes in <b>Python</b> (CIS-15), <b>C++</b> (CS-11M) and <b>BASH</b> (CIS-98). <b>Information Security</b> is more important than ever with a booming job market. I've taught Cabrillo's introduction to computer security (CIS-75) and forensics (CIS-77) classes. <b>Databases</b> are an integral part of most modern applications. CIS-54 is an introduction to relational database management systems. <b>Networking</b> is how we turn computers into working systems and the cloud. I've taught the introduction to networking (CIS-81) and how to debug networks using <a href="http://www.wireshark.org" target="_blank">Wireshark</a> (CIS-140NA). I'm a <b>Linux</b> expert and I've taught Cabrillo's advanced Linux courses, CIS-191, CIS-192 and CIS-193. <b>Windows</b> is the operating system for work. I've taught all of Cabrillo's advanced Windows classes (CIS-194, CIS-195 and CIS-196).</p>
   <h4>Professional Experience</h4>
   <p>Prior to working at Cabrillo I spent 15 years at <a href="http://www.xilinx.com" target="_blank">Xilinx</a> INC. Xilinx is the world's leading supplier of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array", target="_blank">Field Programmable Gate Arrays</a>, a type of microchip that is programmed to emulate other chips. I began my career as a logic designer, producing self-test circuits and have three circuit patents: <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US6239611B1/" target="_blank">US6239611B1</a>, <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US6651238B1/" target="_blank">US6651238B1</a>, <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US8212576B1/" target="_blank">US8212576B1</a>.</p>
	 <p>My career at Xilinx was varied and I did significant programming work in <b>PERL</b>, <b>C++</b> and <b>Java</b>. I designed and constructed <b>embedded Linux systems</b>, producing purpose built test platforms with corresponding Linux drivers and software. I wrote a domain specific programming language to simplify the process of testing embedded systems using <b><a href="http://www.antlr.org" target="_blank">ANTLR</a></b>. I designed, built and maintained <b>datacenters</b> that provide world wide access to special-purpose test hardware.</p>
	 <h4>Education</h4>
	 <p>I have a B.S. in Computer Engineering from <a href="http://www.ucsc.edu" target="_blank">UC Santa Cruz</a></p>
