### Course Description

Teaches the fundamental concepts and models of application development including the basic concepts of program design, data structures, programming, problem solving, programming logic, and fundamental design techniques for event-driven programs. Provides hands-on experience with a modern application programming language and development platform. May be offered in Distance-learning Format.

### Student Learner Outcomes

  - Develop small programs that implement basic algorithmic designs.
  - Organize and document program code following the principles of software engineering.
  
### Objectives

  - Use primitive data types and data structures offered by the development environment.
  - Choose an appropriate data structure for modeling a simple problem.
  - Identify basic programming concepts.
  - Write simple applications that relate to a specific domain.
  - Design, implement, test, and debug a program that uses each of the following fundamental programming constructs: basic computation, simple I/O, standard conditional and iterative structures, and the definition of functions.
  - Test applications with sample data.
  - Apply core program control structures.

### Grading Policy

  - 60% Labs and Homework
  - 20% Midterm
  - 20% Final

### TBA (To Be Arranged) Lab Hours

This course meets weekly at the times shown in the Cabrillo Schedule of Classes and above. In addition each student is required to spend lab time every week in either the CIS Lab (room 830) or online using the CIS VLab. Students may choose the time and day for their TBA Lab Hours where they will work on lab assignments designed to give them practical hands-on experience and continue the learning process. These TBA lab hours are required, tracked, and graded. It is the student's responsibility to complete the TBA lab hours, which start on Week 1 of the term, and record their attendance. Tip: A great time to do TBA lab hours is in the CIS Lab when the instructor is there. If that is not possible, questions can always be posted on the electronic help forum which is monitored by the instructor.

### Late Work Will Not Be Accepted

Homework is due one hour before class on the calendar date where the homework is listed.Please complete all assignments on time as they will not be accepted if they are late. This will help both the student and instructor keep the class moving and avoid log jams at the end of the term. If an assignment is not complete by the deadline it is better to make an incomplete submission for partial credit than no submission at all. There may be extra credit work for students needing extra points.

### Classroom Etiquette

It is important to have an effective, distraction-free classroom environment for learning. To minimize distractions all cell-phones should be turned off or at least silenced. Never carry on conversations during the lecture as this is probably the most annoying distraction possible to those sitting nearby.
 
 For students in the physical classroom, computers can be turned on for viewing lecture slides locally, Google-ing related technical information, and doing classroom exercises. A student's full attention is desired so the computers should not be used during lecture for email or anything that would distract them or others from the material being taught.
 
 For students in the virtual classroom, use the "Raise hand" icon in CCC Confer to let the instructor know you have a question. The chat window can be used to ask questions and communicate with the instructor or other classmates. For students dialing in please use *6 on your phone to mute/unmute your line so background noises in your location don't distract the class.
 
 Please plan on coming to all classes. If class will be missed let the instructor know ahead of time. It is the student's responsibility to get any missed material or information from other classmates (the forum is a good way to do this). Please note that being disruptive is grounds for being dropped from the class by the instructor.
 
### Academic Conduct

Instructors at Cabrillo will not tolerate any forms of academic dishonesty. We do not accept remarkably similar assignments. Students who engage in violations of academic integrity (cheating, plagiarizing print or electronic sources, copying computer files, web site content) as outlined in Cabrillo's "[Student Rights and Responsibilities"](http://www.cabrillo.edu/services/studentaffairs/documents/rightsresponsibilities.pdf) document are subject to disciplinary action by the instructor including receiving an "F" for the assignment, being dropped from the course with a "W" or being issued an "F" for the course.
 
### Special Learning Needs

Veterans or students with disabilities, including "invisible" disabilities such as chronic diseases, learning, and psychological disabilities, are encouraged to explain their needs and appropriate accommodations to the instructor during office hours. Please bring a verification of your disability from the Learning Skills or DSPS offices and a counselor or specialist's recommendations for accommodating your needs.
 
 As required by the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), accommodations are provided to insure equal opportunity for students with verified disabilities. If you need assistance with an accommodation, please contact the [Learning Skills Program](http://www.cabrillo.edu/academics/learningskills/) at 831-479-6220 (for students with learning disabilities and attention deficit disorders) or [Disabled Student Programs and Services](http://www.cabrillo.edu/services/dsps/index.html) (DSPS) at 831-479-6379 or 831-479-6421 (TTY) to make arrangements as soon as possible.
 
Students interested in receiving accommodations and services can contact the ASC at (831) 479-6379 to schedule an appointment to meet with one of the ASC counselors. Please arrive 15 minutes prior to the scheduled appointment to fill out necessary paperwork.
ASC is located outside Room 1073 in The Hub, upstairs behind the library.

### Missing Classes and Drops

It is the student's responsibility to officially withdraw from classes. If you miss more than two classes or two lab assignments, the instructor may drop you from the course enrollment unless prior arrangements have been made and agreed to.
